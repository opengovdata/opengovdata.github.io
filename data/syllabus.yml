course_title: "Reading Group (Open Government Data)"
course_number: "6351"
description: "Federal, state, and local governments have increasingly adopted open-data policies (e.g., OMB Memorandum M-10-06), created new open-data portals (e.g., data.gov), and established new open-data offices (Chief Data Officers, Chief Innovation Officers, etc.), all with an eye toward promoting open-government data. This reading group will explore several key legal and technological issues related to open government data, discuss the implications of open data for personal privacy and on civic society, and examine the effect that open data may have on the practice of law."

  - meta: "Written Requirement"
    content: |
      In keeping with the norm in the open-data "space," all participants must write reaction essays in the form of a "blog post" based on the reading assignments or class discussion.

      With the exception of the first post, the posts should be based on the reading materials for the upcoming class. So, for example, the post for session #4 will be based on the reading materials on "Privacy and 'Big' Open Data" and will be due by midnight two days class (see "Deadlines and Late Work"). The first post will be due by midnight two days before the second session.

      Each post should be roughly 500-1,000 words. And even though iterative drafting and commenting is highly encouraged, the post will be evaluated based on the last version before the deadline.
  - meta: "Deadlines and Late Work"
    content: "All essays must be turned in by midnight two days before class. An essay that is late will have 4 points deducted for each day. For example, if class is held on Wednesday, the reaction essay for that class will be due at midnight on Monday."
  - meta: "Grading Rubric"
    content: "The course will be graded out of 100 points. Each of 6 essays will receive a maximum of 10 points, based on the technical and substantive quality of writing. The remaining 40 points will be based on participation in class and through peer review of others' essays. In order to pass the course, you will need 65 points. This course is graded on a CR/NC basis."
  - meta: "Class Attendance"
    content: |
      As reflected in the GW Law School Bulletin, "[r]egular class attendance is required and is necessary for successful work. A student who is deficient in class attendance or participation will, after the instructor or [D]ean of [S]tudents attempts to communicate with the student, have a grade of No Credit (NC) entered on the record absent an excuse. (Here, as elsewhere in the Bulletin, email correspondence to a student's official Law School email address is one fully acceptable means for student notification.) No excuse for deficient attendance or participation will be granted except by the dean of students and then only upon proof of unexpected serious illness, injury, or other emergency. A student whose excuse is accepted by the dean of students will be withdrawn administratively from the course." (GW Law School Bulletin, p. 19 & 39).
  - meta: "Disability Support Services"
    content: "Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) at:  202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and the Dean of Students Office at 202-994-8320 to coordinate reasonable accommodations.  For additional information please refer to: http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/.  Remember, Law School examination protocol calls for anonymous grading and disclosure of disability to a professor has the potential to breach exam anonymity.  Students may contact the Dean of Students Office regarding registering with the Office of DSS or eligibility to receive accommodations (e.g., notetaking assistance, adaptive technologies, etc.)."
  - meta: "Academic Integrity Policy"
    content: "Students must strictly adhere to the GW Law School's Academic Integrity Code (see GW Law School Bulletin) and publication Citing Responsibly, and the University's Code of Student Conduct."
  - meta: "Recording of Classes"
    content: |
      This course will follow the Law School's "Class Recording Policy," available at the Dean of Students Office Website.  Essentially, students may request class recordings when they will be absent for religious reasons, family emergencies, and other authorized absences.  Requests for recording and questions about the policy should be directed to the Dean of Students Office.

    topic: The DATA Act
    description: "In 2014, Congress enacted the DATA Act, which mandated the establishment of government-wide data standards for financial data and required publication of 'consistent, reliable, and searchable government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for tax-payers and policy makers.' Three years later, the DATA Act is now the law of the land and has been implemented by the federal government. This session will explore how the DATA Act came to exist and what implementation of major open-data legislation looks like."

        - The author describes the origins of the DATA Act as beginning with the stimulus bill -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- and the implementation of standards by Earl Devaney. Remember, that Rumsey suggested that the origins were grounded in FFATA. What do you make of these competing origin stories? What do origin stories suggest about the *goals* of legislation? What do they suggest about the authors' interpretation of those goals?
        - The article describes some of the interest group politics involved. What were their incentives? What was the impact of their advocacy? What about the executive branch's incentives? What was the impact of their advocacy?
        - The author suggests that the result of the legislative process was a weakened law. What does this suggest about how how to approach open-government-data policies?

        - Take a look at the document's vision for Federal Spending in 2022. What are the suggested primary benefits associated with the DATA Act? Who are the beneficiaries. To what extent is that vision consistent with the original stated intent of the DATA Act?
        - The DATA Act took 3 years to implement from passage in 2014 to first public reporting in 2017. Total implementation is supposed to be complete in 2021. What are your predictions about what happens in 2022?
        - What are the challenges with continued implementation of the DATA Act? What are the solutions?
        - In the next session, we will discuss what level of responsibility the government has to provide "context" to data it publishes and to explicitly engage consumers of data. What are the authors' views on the government's responsibility to engage the public around the data?

      discussion:
      - As the author notes, "most police information about sexual assault cases is protected." How does she get the data described in the article? How do these techniques inform how other open-government data inquiries can be carried out?
      - As you read through this article, consider how public data about law-enforcement techniques provides accountability for law-enforcement. To what extent does data *about* the government's actions help promote better government? Again, what is the role of civil society in this?
      - Over the semester, we've discussed the incentives for public officials related to open government data. What are the incentives for law-enforcement agencies?

  - session: "6"
    date: 2018-03-28
    topic: "Efficacy of Open Government Data"
    description: "This session will explore whether open government data policies are living up to their promise and ask what should be expected from an open government data policy? What are the successes and failures for open government data? How are cities and states using open government data? What's likely to come next for open government data?"

      discussion:
      - The authors describe a very specific definition of what constitutes an effective open government initiative. What are the criteria? Consider Yu & Robinson's framework. To what extent have the authors assumed this framework in their analysis? What tradeoffs does this imply? To what extent are the frameworks different?
      - How persuasive do you find the concept of the principal-agent model? How does that model correspond to the "Invisible Hand" concept?
      - Consider the 14 Principles of Open Government Data. To what extent is the framework advanced by authors similar or different from the 14 Principles?

      discussion:
      - The post argues that open data is "pre-political", or in the alternative, that it's "good politics." Do you agree? Why?
      - The article describes several objections to open data policies. In this class, we've discussed other barriers to open government data. How do you see those barriers playing out over time?
      - What does the post argue about what the right levels of expectation ought to be for open data policies?
      - The post contends that the open-data movement's long-term outcome will depend on politics. True?

      discussion:
      - As the article notes, algorithmic transparency legislation is "cutting edge." What does the bill in question actually *do*?
      - What are the origin stories involved in the legislation? What are the politics? To what extent are the politics in play similar or different from other open-government-data policies?
      - One of the findings cited was that the algorithm that prompted the legislation had "a margin of error of 30 percent for one key input of the program." To what extent is the desire for algorithmic transparency connected to the accuracy of the algorithm? What are the implications of that relationship? What lessons should we draw from Paul Ohm's article as it relates to this relationship?

      discussion:
      - What is the authors' core critique around the need for algorithmic transparency?
      - The authors identify 3 impediments to algorithmic transparency. What are they? To what extent do they parallel other open-government challenges? What does that imply about how these impediments might be addressed?
      - What politics are embedded in use of algorithms? To what extent are these politics new or different?
      - What were the authors' experiences in using open-records laws to obtain information about algorithmic transparency? Why does this matter? What are the authors' solutions to these experiences?
      - What do the authors suggest should be documented with regard to algorithms?
