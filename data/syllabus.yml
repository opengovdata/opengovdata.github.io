course_title: "Reading Group (Open Government Data)"
course_number: "6351"
description: "Federal, state, and local governments have increasingly adopted open-data policies (e.g., OMB Memorandum M-10-06), created new open-data portals (e.g., data.gov), and established new open-data offices (Chief Data Officers, Chief Innovation Officers, etc.), all with an eye toward promoting open-government data. This reading group will explore several key legal and technological issues related to open government data, discuss the implications of open data for personal privacy and on civic society, and examine the effect that open data may have on the practice of law."

  - meta: "Written Requirement"
    content: |
      In keeping with the norm in the open-data "space," all participants must write reaction essays in the form of a "blog post" based on the reading assignments or class discussion.

      With the exception of the first post, the posts should be based on the reading materials for the upcoming class. So, for example, the post for session #4 will be based on the reading materials on "Privacy and 'Big' Open Data" and will be due by midnight two days class (see "Deadlines and Late Work"). The first post will be due by midnight two days before the second session.

      Each post should be roughly 500-1,000 words. And even though iterative drafting and commenting is highly encouraged, the post will be evaluated based on the last version before the deadline.
  - meta: "Deadlines and Late Work"
    content: "All essays must be turned in by midnight two days before class. An essay that is late will have 4 points deducted for each day. For example, if class is held on Wednesday, the reaction essay for that class will be due at midnight on Monday."
  - meta: "Grading Rubric"
    content: "The course will be graded out of 100 points. Each of 6 essays will receive a maximum of 10 points, based on the technical and substantive quality of writing. The remaining 40 points will be based on participation in class and through peer review of others' essays. In order to pass the course, you will need 65 points. This course is graded on a CR/NC basis."
  - meta: "Class Attendance"
    content: |
      As reflected in the GW Law School Bulletin, "[r]egular class attendance is required and is necessary for successful work. A student who is deficient in class attendance or participation will, after the instructor or [D]ean of [S]tudents attempts to communicate with the student, have a grade of No Credit (NC) entered on the record absent an excuse. (Here, as elsewhere in the Bulletin, email correspondence to a student's official Law School email address is one fully acceptable means for student notification.) No excuse for deficient attendance or participation will be granted except by the dean of students and then only upon proof of unexpected serious illness, injury, or other emergency. A student whose excuse is accepted by the dean of students will be withdrawn administratively from the course." (GW Law School Bulletin, p. 19 & 39).
  - meta: "Disability Support Services"
    content: "Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) at:  202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and the Dean of Students Office at 202-994-8320 to coordinate reasonable accommodations.  For additional information please refer to: http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/.  Remember, Law School examination protocol calls for anonymous grading and disclosure of disability to a professor has the potential to breach exam anonymity.  Students may contact the Dean of Students Office regarding registering with the Office of DSS or eligibility to receive accommodations (e.g., notetaking assistance, adaptive technologies, etc.)."
  - meta: "Academic Integrity Policy"
    content: "Students must strictly adhere to the GW Law School's Academic Integrity Code (see GW Law School Bulletin) and publication Citing Responsibly, and the University's Code of Student Conduct."
  - meta: "Recording of Classes"
    content: |
      This course will follow the Law School's "Class Recording Policy," available at the Dean of Students Office Website.  Essentially, students may request class recordings when they will be absent for religious reasons, family emergencies, and other authorized absences.  Requests for recording and questions about the policy should be directed to the Dean of Students Office.

    topic: Introduction to Open Government Data
    description: "What is open government data? What makes open government data different from preexisting transparency-related efforts, such as the Freedom of Information Act? How is open government data used? What role do governments play—and what role should they play—in collecting, disseminating, and using open government data?"

        discussion:
        - For each era, what are the motivations for the creation of open government data?
        - What are the motivations in the United States for open government laws? Are they similar to those in the historical examples? Why or why not?

        discussion:
        - What does "open government data" really mean?
        - Does Yu and Robinson's assessment of the history of open government laws align with Tauberer's?
        - What do you make of Yu and Robinson's framework? Does it help eliminate ambiguity in what constitutes "useful" open government data?
        - What are examples of data sets that lawyers use? Where do they fit on the spectrum?

        discussion:
        - Willis observes that the Plum Book is available in PDF, but that it "isn't particularly searchable." He instead says that it's "basically a long list of names." What data types might be appropriate for the Plum Book?
        - Willis mentions "JSON data". What kind of data type does JSON look like? He also mentions YAML. What is YAML? What other things [might be represented by YAML](https://github.com/opengovdata/opengovdata.github.io/blob/master/data/syllabus.yml)?
        - How would an API be useful for the Plum Book?

And what clues do you have about where it came from?
        - Take a look at [the Appointee Tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker). How do you think that the Washington Post updates it? How *could* it be updated?

        discussion:
        - How did Li and his collaborators go about discovering the likely author of unsigned Supreme Court opinions?
        - Recall Willis's point about the Plum Book and PDFs. What is the mode by which the Supreme Court publishes its information? What are the drawbacks?
        - What questions would you want answered about judicial data? Where do you think such data exist?

    topic: The DATA Act
    description: "In 2014, Congress enacted the DATA Act, which mandated the establishment of government-wide data standards for financial data and required publication of 'consistent, reliable, and searchable government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for tax-payers and policy makers.' Three years later, the DATA Act is now the law of the land and has been implemented by the federal government. This session will explore how the DATA Act came to exist and what implementation of major open-data legislation looks like."

    topic: Privacy, Law Enforcement, and "Big" Open Data
    description: |
      One of the most commonly cited concerns about open government data is personal privacy and the "mosaic" effect of big data. What are the social implications with collection and dissemination of government data? How should governments address privacy when thinking about open government data? How does law-enforcement's increasing reliance on surveillance technologies figure into open data?
