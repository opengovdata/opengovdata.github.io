semester: "Spring 2005"
course_title: "Reading Group (Open Government Data)"
course_number: "6351"
description: "Federal, state, and local governments have increasingly adopted open-data policies (e.g., OMB Memorandum M-10-06), created new open-data portals (e.g., data.gov), and established new open-data offices (Chief Data Officers, Chief Innovation Officers, etc.), all with an eye toward promoting open-government data. This reading group will explore several key legal and technological issues related to open government data, discuss the implications of open data for personal privacy and on civic society, and examine the effect that open data may have on the practice of law."

    content: "V. David Zvenyach, [dave@esq.io](mailto:dave@esq.io), (202) 596-1770"
  - meta: "Pre-Requisites"
    content: "There are no pre-requisites for this course."
  - meta: "Written Requirement"
    content: "In keeping with the norm in the open-data “space,” all participants must write reaction essays in the form of a “blog post” based on the reading assignments or class discussion. Class participants are also encouraged to engage in iterative drafting and comment on other participants' posts. The blog posts will be hosted on GitHub <https://github.com> so participants should sign up for a user account.\nWith the exception of the first post, the posts should be based on the reading materials for the upcoming class. So, for example, the post for session #4 will be based on the reading materials on “Privacy and 'Big' Open Data” and will be due by midnight two days class (see “Deadlines and Late Work”). The first post will be due by midnight two days before the second session.\nEach post should be roughly 500-1,000 words. And even though iterative drafting and commenting is highly encouraged, the post will be evaluated based on the last version before the deadline."
  - meta: "Deadlines and Late Work"
    content: "All essays must be turned in by midnight two days before class. An essay that is late will have 4 points deducted for each day. For example, if class is held on Wednesday, the reaction essay for that class will be due at midnight on Monday."
  - meta: "Grading Rubric"
    content: "The course will be graded out of 100 points. Each of 6 essays will receive a maximum of 10 points, based on the technical and substantive quality of writing. The remaining 40 points will be based on participation in class and through peer review of others' essays. In order to pass the course, you will need 65 points. This course is graded on a CR/NC basis."
  - meta: "Class Attendance"
    content: "As reflected in the GW Law School Bulletin, “[r]egular class attendance is required and is necessary for successful work. A student who is deficient in class attendance or participation will, after the instructor or [D]ean of [S]tudents attempts to communicate with the student, have a grade of No Credit (NC) entered on the record absent an excuse. (Here, as elsewhere in the Bulletin, email correspondence to a student’s official Law School email address is one fully acceptable means for student notification.) No excuse for deficient attendance or participation will be granted except by the dean of students and then only upon proof of unexpected serious illness, injury, or other emergency. A student whose excuse is accepted by the dean of students will be withdrawn administratively from the course.” (GW Law School Bulletin, p. 19 & 39)."
  - meta: "Disability Support Services"
    content: "Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) at:  202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to establish eligibility and the Dean of Students Office at 202-994-8320 to coordinate reasonable accommodations.  For additional information please refer to: http://gwired.gwu.edu/dss/.  Remember, Law School examination protocol calls for anonymous grading and disclosure of disability to a professor has the potential to breach exam anonymity.  Students may contact the Dean of Students Office regarding registering with the Office of DSS or eligibility to receive accommodations (e.g., notetaking assistance, adaptive technologies, etc.)."
  - meta: "Academic Integrity Policy"
    content: "Students must strictly adhere to the GW Law School’s Academic Integrity Code (see GW Law School Bulletin) and publication Citing Responsibly, and the University’s Code of Student Conduct."
  - meta: "Recording of Classes"
    content: "This course will follow the Law School’s “Class Recording Policy,” available at the Dean of Students Office Website.  Essentially, students may request class recordings when they will be absent for religious reasons, family emergencies, and other authorized absences.  Requests for recording and questions about the policy should be directed to the Dean of Students Office."
