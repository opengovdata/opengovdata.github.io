# 6351 Reading Group: Open Government Data (Spring 2016)

## Description
Federal, state, and local governments have increasingly adopted open-data policies (e.g., OMB Memorandum M-10-06), created new open-data portals (e.g., data.gov), and established new open-data offices (Chief Data Officers, Chief Innovation Officers, etc.), all with an eye toward promoting open-government data. This reading group will explore several key legal and technological issues related to open government data, discuss the implications of open data for personal privacy and on civic society, and examine the effect that open data may have on the practice of law.
