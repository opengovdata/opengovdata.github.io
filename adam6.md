I tend to agree with the the skepticism put forth by Evgeny Morozovmarch and Tom Lee with respect to the efficacy of open data as applied to open government initiatives. What Lee describes as "the inescapability of politics" rings back to our previous discussion and reading about mapping bus routes in Chennai, India. Would it be useful? Yes. Should it be controversial? Probably not. But can politics (or political bureaucracy) easily squash the promise of open data? YES. That's why I like Lee's idea of using open data as an "add-on to existing politics." Open data, in my view, is an enabler, but not really a force in and of itself. As for commercial applicability, I agree with Morozovmarch that open data is probably a hit-or-miss proposition. Commercial utility is certainly one valid reason to support and encourage governments to open up their data to the public, but we should expect to see the types successes and failures common to all business ventures. This is especially true given that government-held data is finite and accessible on common terms to all potential users/developers (in theory). So, I would think the focus should first on the realm of politics and governance and then on commercial utility of open data. 

The Cordis and Warren article is a really good demonstration of this idea. If accurate, I think it's pretty astounding that there's such an apparently strong correlation between open data and prosecutions for corruption. That alone is a good enough reason for me to support open data -- never mind the added bonus of whatever commercial applications also result. This would also explain why the local executive and legislative branches in Boston were clambering over one another to frame the city's open data policy. Rebecca Williams article on the Boston scenario seems to further illustrate that government officials are very aware of the power of open data to expose the inner workings of government. And, of course, they want to be able to control that exposure. It's interesting, and perhaps telling, that Boston Mayor Walsh's executive order was less comprehensive than the measure proposed by Councilor Wu. Based on what we know about FOIA, I would assume that most of the data that would be affected by an open data policy rests within the executive, so Walsh's executive order may have sought to undercut Wu's more expansive proposal. 

My takeaway is that open data is a trending, activist-based movement ("opiate of the (iPad-toting) masses", to borrow Morozovmarch's phrase) that will have some lasting efficacy, but will probably not attain the full range of ideals we've examined this semester. If I'm right, the smart thing to do pursue open data policies but to focus on the areas where we can get the most bang for our bucks -- in addressing problems like transparency / corruption and enhancing public services. At the same time, we should encourage public-private partnerships and promote the commercial utility of government data, never forgetting what we know about privacy, deidentification, and anonymization.
